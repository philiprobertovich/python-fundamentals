# Python Fundamentals-list_sayer, dict_sayer, greatest, zipper

### By Philip Kendall

#### This application creates 4 functions: list_sayer, dict_sayer, greatest, and zipper

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Git

## Description

* list_sayer: This functions takes a list as an arguement. It will then break down that list based upon its element and its according index position by outputing a string that will state each element in the list as well as it's index poistion. It will then return true. If the list is empty, the function will return false and print "Your list is empty". 
* dict_sayer: This function takes a dictionary as an arguement. It will then break down the list based upon its keys and values by outputting a string that states each according key and its value. This will also return true. If the dictionary is empty, it will output "Your dictionary is empty" and return false.
* greatest: This function takes a dictionary as an arguement. It will then find and output the biggest integer value within the dictionary.
* zipper: This function takes two lists as arguements. If the lists contain the same amount of elements, then it will take the elements from both lists and match then up accordingly based upon their respective index positions. It will then take the matched list elements and put them into a dictionary where each matched pair now share a 'key:value' relationship. The function will then return the dictionary. If the lists are different lengths, then the function will return a tuple of each list and how many elements are contained in each.
