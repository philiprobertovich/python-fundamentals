# Python Fundamentals-list_sayer, dict_sayer, greatest, zipper

### By Philip Kendall

#### This application creates 4 functions: list_sayer, dict_sayer, greatest, and zipper

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Git

## Description

* list_sayer: This functions takes a list as an arguement. It will then break down that list based upon its element and its according index position by outputing a string that will state each element in the list as well as it's index poistion. It will then return true. If the list is empty, the function will return false and print "Your list is empty". 
* dict_sayer: This function takes a dictionary as an arguement. It will then break down the list based upon its keys and values by outputting a string that states each according key and its value. This will also return true. If the dictionary is empty, it will output "Your dictionary is empty" and return false.
* greatest: This function takes a dictionary as an arguement. It will then find and output biggest integer value within the dictionary.
* zipper: This function takes two lists as arguements. If the lists contain the same amount of elements, then it take the elements from both lists and match then up accordingly based upon their respective index positions. It will then take the matched list elements and put them into a dictionary where each matched pair now share a 'key:value' relationship. The function will then return the dictionary. If the lists are different lengths, then the function will return a tuple of each list and how many elements are contained in each.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
